## CS52 lab 4

For this lab a created a content platform that relies on a CRUD api to create, update, and delete content. Initially, I did not understand redux. Now I am a beast at manipulating the Redux state. I heavily used Material UI for styling.

This is what i used to help make the navbar.

Error Handling: If the user leaves a field empty while editing a post or creating a new post, a dialog will appear telling them they need to fill in the specified field. Aditionally, the text field that is left empty will have a red border box letting the user know where their mistake was.

Filtering: At the top of the page is a nice filter search bar. There is no submit button. The posts automaticalky update based on what is in that input field. I used the .toLowerCase() function to handle case discrepancies, so search results are more accurate. Anywhere you see a tag, in posts or post/id, you can click on the tag and be brought to filter of all posts with that specific tag. This allows users to find posts simmilar to the one they are currently viewing. 

I added a cool particle affect to the backbroung!
